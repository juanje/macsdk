"""Response models for {{ name }}.

By default, agents use BaseAgentResponse which provides:
- response_text: str - Human-readable response
- tools_used: list[str] - Tools that were called

This is sufficient for most agents. The supervisor receives
the response_text via the tool wrapper.

To add custom structured fields (for advanced use cases like
inter-agent coordination), uncomment and extend below.
